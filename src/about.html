                    </p>
                    <p>One major task of the on-going project Diplomatics and Palaeography of Neo- and Late Babylonian Archival Documents led by M. Jursa at the Universtiy of Vienna is the establishment of a website dedicated to cuneiform palaeography in the first millennium BCE. It will be arranged by graphemes in the sequence of a conventional Assyriological sign list. For each grapheme, the corpus of attested forms (allographs) will be shown in the form of digital images. These allographs will be classified with respect to their date, the period to which they belong, as well as their city of origin, archive, text type and, as far as possible, scribe. A search engine will allow multi-fold investigations within the corpus of sign forms, the identification of the interrelationship between certain allographs of certain signs, and generally the exploration of many aspects of the several ductūs above the level of individual signs. In this way it will serve as a dynamic and flexible research tool for all on-going investigations in the field of Late Babylonian studies, and in doing so, it will close a significant gap in our knowledge of the period.</p>

                        The second objective is the establishment of a website dedicated specifically to Neo- and Late Babylonian palaeography. It will elucidate the diachronic development of sign forms and will allow, through cumulative evidence, the identification of standard forms as well as of scribal idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, owing to the possibility of multiple cross-referencing, it will allow for the first time an investigation of the interrelation between the several developmental stages of different signs. In this way it will serve as a dynamic and flexible research tool for all on-going investigations in the field of Late Babylonian studies, and in doing so, it will close a significant gap in our knowledge of the period. </p>
                    <p>
                        The core of the website, however, will be a MySQL database for the presentation of the visual data on the level of individual signs and ligatures. It will be arranged by graphemes in the sequence of a conventional Assyriological sign list. For each grapheme, the corpus of attested forms (allographs) on which the standard sign forms presented in the sign-list in the monograph are based will be shown (in the form of digital images). These allographs will be classified with respect to their date, the period (as defined above) to which they belong, as well as their city of origin, archive, text type and, as far as possible, scribe. A search engine will allow multi-fold investigations within the corpus of sign forms, the identification of the interrelationship between certain allographs of certain signs, and generally the exploration of many aspects of the several ductūs above the level of individual signs. The sign list will thus evolve into a dynamic tool for cuneiform epigraphy which will allow easy reference for scholars and students alike, and which can also be kept up-to-date easily after the end of the active phase of the project.</p>
                    <p>
                        Compared to alphabetic scripts, cuneiform displays a relatively high number of features pertinent to the ductus of the script – the latter being defined as “the order and direction of the traces in the configurations required for the basic shapes of the letters in a particular script” (Parkes 2008, 251, quoted after van den Hout 2012, 152) –  which can be objectified and analysed. A list given by Daniels 1995 (82) with no claims to being exhaustive comprises stylus, stylus angle, depth of impression, basic wedges, basic wedge clusters, order of wedges, number of wedges per sign, relative size of signs, horizontal distribution of signs, lengthening of horizontal strokes (cf. Edzard 1976-80, 545b, who distinguishes between Griffeleindruck and Strich), horizontal/vertical sign alignment, distribution of text on tablet: some of the criteria for defining a “ductus” can be identified on, and are linked to, the level of individual signs; others, such as the stylus angle, are particular to all signs on a tablet or pertaining to a certain type of script. To this one can add the use of ligatures as well as a description of the single wedges making up a given sign as conditioned by writing material (cf. Powell 1981, 426-431). As in the case of the terminology for tablet formats, we will establish a coherent (multilingual) terminology that will be used in the project publications. This will be done in close consultation with our cooperation partners, in particular with J. Taylor and Ch. Walker of the British Museum. </p>
                    <p>
                        On this basis, and as outlined above, the principal interest of our palaeographic research is to identify the standard (or most common) sign forms for the several periods defined sub 3.1, and to try and establish the presence of peculiarities linked to geographical origin, archive, and, in particular cases, scribes or bureaus. By using the flexible tool of a database (and its open-access website front), the possibility of multiple cross-referencing will open up, allowing for the demonstration of the interrelation between the several developmental stages of different signs. On a more abstract level of analysis, it will be attempted to objectify the frequently – and impressionistically! – made distinctions between ‘formal’ or ‘calligraphic’ and ‘cursive’ ductūs. The website will serve also as a research (and teaching) tool, allowing easy access to the palaeographic information that is relevant for the study of Babylonian socio-economic texts of the first millennium BC.
                     </p>
                    <p>   Data gathering that aims at the identification of standard sign forms, i.e., of the most common allographs of certain graphemes, will have to be set up in a controlled way so as to gather cumulative evidence that can make a claim to being representative of the corpus. Standard procedure will be to take the period of origin of the tablets as the first category of analysis and to include in the database of sign forms (in the form of digital images) up to two attestations of every single sign or ligature represented on the tablet for every tablet analysed, up to a maximum of 40, beyond which number only extraordinary allographs will be taken into account (which will be flagged as such in the database). At this point of data gathering, an interim analysis will establish the degree of variation found for the several signs, identifying ‘diagnostic’ graphemes that exhibit a significant range of allographs (for the concept of diagnostic signs see van den Hout 2012, 148 (Table 2) and Weeden 2012, 238ff.). For these signs, data collection will be continued up to one hundred attestations. For most periods it is possible to introduce meaningful sub-categories for data-gathering and analysis. Thus, from the late seventh century onwards, we can distinguish Babylon-, Borsippa-, Sippar- and Uruk-sub-corpora, and occasionally it may be useful to distinguish also archival groups (foremost Egibi, Ebabbar, Eanna and Rē’i-alpi, for the sixth century). The corpora and sub-corpora, defined by period, or by city (and/or archive) and period, will be of varying sizes, but as a rule they should not include fewer than fifty tablets (but for some periods this will not be possible in the case of several cities), and it will only occasionally be necessary (or even possible), to take into account well above 150 tablets. </p>
                    <p>
                        For the late Achaemenid, Seleucid and Parthian period, the Astronomical Diaries will form an important sub-corpus. It is conceivable that they can serve as a chronologically calibrated yardstick for palaeographical development in the final centuries of the first millennium, but it is possible that in the final analysis their ductus may in fact have to be kept separate from that of many (but not all) of the archival tablets of the time because of its stable and calligraphic character: it may be closer to what is designated in medieval studies as a formal Buchschrift, in contrast to the cursives of documents (van Brandt 2007, 71; John 1992, 31-2); in this sense, the Astronomical Diaries may serve as a link between the data treated by the present project and a future (and much needed) epigraphic investigation of literary texts of the late first millennium BC. The palaeographic analysis of the Astronomical Diaries will take tablets with a definite and late post quem date – such as the (fortunately very rich) corpus of Diaries from the succession of the Parthian king Mithridates II (123 BC) onwards – as a reference corpus in comparison to which the earlier material will be assessed. This way, the problem of tablets being copies from a significantly later date than the events they narrate can be adequately accounted for. The Diaries are in fact a particularly promising corpus for a study of palaeography because of their strongly formalized language and their very orthography that remained stable over centuries: this facilitates the identification of diagnostic signs.</p>
                    <p>
                        The analysis of signs will combine the straightforward autoptical examination of (types of) allographs with a formalized description based on the standardized terminology mentioned above. By cross-referencing, allographs of different diagnostic signs that tend to co-occur can be identified, and a meta-level of general allograph formation detected. Phenomena like the adoption of a particular stylus angle for vertical (sometimes also horizontal) wedges or the choice of fewer (or more) (vertical) wedges in signs that allow such variability tend to be present consistently in all or most signs of a tablet, and, as a small sample of pertinent investigations suggests, also in most, if not all, tablets written by an individual scribe (e.g., Jursa and Wagensonner, in press; Jursa 1999a, 22-25). Such observations will lead to the definition of a certain number of more or less distinct ductūs, which, depending on the level of generalization achieved, on the one hand may be typical for certain periods and cities (such as the ductus of the very distinct property documents of the late seventh century from Babylon, or that of the Sipparean tablets of the reign of Darius represented in the archives of Bēl-rēmanni and Marduk-rēmanni [Jursa 1999a; Waerzeggers in press]), or, on the other, can serve as a stepping stone towards the study of individual handwritings: a topic which we will engage with in the case of a few well-attested scribes.</p>
