cfdb - cuneiform DB
======================

This is a database for cuneiform tablets and signs, based on exist-db and betterFORM.

**NB This is a legacy branch that used a WebDAV setup together with Martin Holmes' Image Markup Tool (http://tapor.uvic.ca/~mholmes/image_markup/) for image annotation** It has been replaced by a browser-based javascript approach that is being developed in the current master branch, but is kept here for reference.
